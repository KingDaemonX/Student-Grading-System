This program is written in the C programming language and is designed to accept student information, including name, student ID, assignment grade, class attended, number of classes, number of students, test grade, student exam grade, and attendance grade, and calculate the final grade for each student.

The program begins by defining a struct called Student that has the following fields:

    name: a character array of length MAX_NAME_LENGTH to store the student's name
    id: an integer to store the student's ID number
    assignmentGrade: an integer to store the student's assignment grade (out of 100)
    classAttended: an integer to store the number of classes the student attended
    numClasses: an integer to store the total number of classes for the course
    testGrade: a float to store the student's test grade (out of 100)
    studentExamGrade: a float to store the student's exam grade (out of 100)
    attendanceGrade: a float to store the student's attendance grade (out of 100)
    finalGrade: a float to store the student's final grade for the course

Next, the program defines a function called calculateFinalGrade that takes in the various inputs for a student and calculates their final grade based on a weighted average of the different inputs. The function returns the final grade as a float.

The program then defines a function called printStudent that takes in a Student struct and prints out all of the information for that student, including their name, ID, assignment grade, class attendance, test grade, exam grade, attendance grade, and final grade.

In the main function, the program begins by asking the user to input the number of students in the class. It then uses a loop to ask the user for information for each student, including their name, ID, assignment grade, class attendance, test grade, exam grade, and attendance grade. For each student, the program calculates their final grade using the calculateFinalGrade function and stores the final grade in the finalGrade field of the Student struct.

Finally, the program uses another loop to print out the information for each student, including their name, ID, assignment grade, class attendance, test grade, exam grade, attendance grade, and final grade.

This formula represents the weights for each of the different inputs. For example, the assignment grade is weighted at 10%, the class attendance is weighted at 10%, the test grade is weighted at 30%, the student exam grade is weighted at 50%, and the attendance grade is weighted at 10%.
